# Basic linked list ( D )
    -> LinkedList is the dynamic data structure.
    -> As we can add or remove elements at ease. ( easy or less difficulty )
    -> It can even grow as needed. Just like arrays.
    -> linked lists store elements sequentially.
    -> It donâ€™t store the elements contiguously like an array. 

# Add, create, & get linked list methods ( D )

# Push node to index ( D )

    % Expected Cases

        * Fix re arranging issue ( D )

            -> Use Array builtin method with assuming that, It's a linked list

        * Test linked list  ( D )

        * Fix the list length issue ( D )

        * When it's inserting to first position ( D )

        * What if he is adding to last ( D )

            -> Fix one issue ( What if there is no items in the list when you are adding to last) 

        * Address should be unique ( D )

# Remove node

    * From Start!, end!, middle!

# Get Node Values

    -> List [[4, "ss34er"], [5, "ss45er"], [5, "ss34ff"]]

    -> Output [4, 5, 8]
